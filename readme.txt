You need just import content of these 3 files to your React js project.

Remove All of your files in Your React project and just use these files or copy and paste on same file name.

probably you use index.js instead of main.jsx, these are same. i import App component in main.jsx.

if you have problem to see content of app, do not forgot install npm by below code and run it:
npm install
npm run dev

if you need help for installing React app go this link:
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started
if you want to use Vitejs go to this link:
https://vitejs.dev/guide/

after installing new app erase all of files except App.js & index.html & main.jsx or index.js!

if you use this code, tap on stars, Thanks!
